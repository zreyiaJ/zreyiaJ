            In the enchanting world of Japanese folklore, Princess Kaguya, a radiant celestial being, held a deep connection to the moon. She relied on the 'Moonlit Scroll' to manage her ethereal tasks.<br/>
            Our mission is to create 'Kaguya's Tasks,' a To-Do List. App inspired by the grace and purpose ofPrincess Kaguya. This app will empower users to organise their daily tasks through to-dos just like Princess Kaguya. The  success of 'Kaguya's Tasksâ€™ will offer users a bridge to the mystical world of Japanese folklore, enabling them to manage their tasks with elegance and purpose, much like
            Princess Kaguya herself. This mission and connects modern task managers to the ethereal realm of Princess Kaguya's stories!
